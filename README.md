# Web3 Gen AI DApp

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for this project comes from the potential of combining large-language models with decentralized technologies to create dynamic, generative NFTs. We aimed to explore how AI-generated content can enhance the uniqueness and value of NFTs, allowing each token to be truly one-of-a-kind and reflective of user input.

## What it does

The **Web3 Gen AI DApp** implements a system where NFTs are created based on AI-generated content. Instead of using arbitrary sequences of bytes as token payloads, this application generates text strings using a large-language model based on user prompts. The AI runs off-chain, typically within a wallet application, and generates content that is then minted as an NFT on-chain. This process allows users to create, customize, and trade NFTs with AI-generated content across different chains within the Linera blockchain ecosystem.

## How we built it

- **AI Model Integration**: We integrated a large-language model into the application service, which runs off-chain within the user's wallet. This model generates the text content that forms the payload of the NFTs.
- **Smart Contracts**: The smart contracts are adapted from a standard NFT example, modified to handle text string payloads generated by the AI model. These contracts manage the minting, transferring, and claiming of NFTs across different chains.
- **Cross-Chain Communication**: The application demonstrates cross-chain messaging, allowing NFTs to be minted, transferred, and claimed across different chains in the Linera ecosystem.
- **Web Frontend**: A web-based interface allows users to interact with the application, mint NFTs, and transfer ownership between users.

## Challenges we ran into

- **AI and Blockchain Integration**: Ensuring smooth integration between the AI model and the blockchain was challenging, particularly in terms of maintaining real-time performance and security.
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: Managing the complexity of cross-chain communication and ensuring the accurate transfer and claiming of NFTs across different chains required careful design and testing.
- **User Experience**: Creating a seamless user experience that bridges the complexities of AI-generated content and decentralized NFT management was a significant challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

1. **Successful AI-Blockchain Integration**: We successfully combined AI-generated content with blockchain technology, creating a novel application for generative NFTs.
2. **Cross-Chain NFT Management**: Demonstrated the ability to mint, transfer, and claim NFTs across different chains, showcasing the flexibility and interoperability of the Linera blockchain.
3. **User-Centric Design**: Developed an intuitive web frontend that allows users to easily interact with the AI model and manage their NFTs.

## What we learned

1. **Advanced AI Techniques**: Gained deeper insights into integrating AI models with decentralized applications, particularly in generating unique digital assets.
2. **Blockchain Development**: Improved our understanding of cross-chain communication and smart contract development within the Linera ecosystem.
3. **User Interface Design**: Learned valuable lessons in designing user-friendly interfaces for complex blockchain applications.

## What's next for Web3 Gen AI DApp

1. **Feature Expansion**: We plan to introduce additional AI-driven customization options to further enhance the uniqueness and value of NFTs.
2. **Scalability Improvements**: Focus on optimizing the performance and scalability of both the AI model and the blockchain infrastructure to support a larger user base.
3. **Community Engagement**: Explore opportunities for community-driven features and governance, allowing users to influence the evolution of the DApp.
4. **Platform Integration**: Look into integrating with other Web3 platforms to expand the reach and functionality of the application.

## Usage

### Setting Up

To set up the application:

```bash
export PATH="$PWD/target/debug:$PATH"
source /dev/stdin <<<"$(linera net helper 2>/dev/null)"

linera_spawn_and_read_wallet_variables linera net up --testing-prng-seed 37
```

Compile the generative NFT application WebAssembly binaries and publish them as application bytecode:

```bash
(cd examples/gen-nft && cargo build --release)

BYTECODE_ID=$(linera publish-bytecode \
    examples/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/gen_nft_{contract,service}.wasm)
```

Store the bytecode ID in a variable `BYTECODE_ID` to be reused later.

### Creating an NFT

Unlike fungible tokens, each NFT is unique and identified by a token ID. To create the NFT application:

```bash
APP_ID=$(linera create-application $BYTECODE_ID)
```

This will store the application ID in a new variable `APP_ID`.

### Using the NFT Application

To interact with the application, start a node service for the current wallet:

```bash
PORT=8080
linera service --port $PORT &
```

### Using GraphiQL

- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/chains/$CHAIN_1/applications/$APP_ID`.
- Mint an NFT using the query:
```gql
mutation {
    mint(
        minter: "User:7136460f0c87ae46f966f898d494c4b40c4ae8c527f4d1c0b1fa0f7cff91d20f",
        prompt: "Hello!"
    )
}
```
- Check the NFT using:
```gql
query {
    nft(tokenId: "9NMD4q5nf2rNy2JQQ9MpUR0c55M8cqeE+Yjngi7t8i0") {
        tokenId,
        owner,
        prompt,
        minter,
    }
}
```

### Using Web Frontend

To start the web server:

```bash
cd examples/gen-nft/web-frontend
npm install --no-save
BROWSER=none npm start &
```

Access the application via:

```bash
echo "http://localhost:3000/$CHAIN_1?app=$APP_ID&owner=$OWNER_1&port=$PORT"
echo "http://localhost:3000/$CHAIN_1?app=$APP_ID&owner=$OWNER_2&port=$PORT"
```
